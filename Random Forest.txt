A random forest is a machine learning technique that's used to solve regression and classification problems.
It utilizes ensemble learning, which is a technique that combines many classifiers to provide solutions to complex problems.
A random forest algorithm consists of many decision trees.


It uses bagging and feature randomness when building each individual tree to try to create an uncorrelated forest of trees
whose prediction by committee is more accurate than that of any individual tree.


Random Forest is one of the most popular and commonly used algorithms across real-life data science projects as well as data
science competitions.
This ensures that there is no bias in the model as there is no particular segment of data or a set of features that
dominates the prediction results.


Random Forest is an ensemble of unpruned classification or regression trees created by using bootstrap samples of the
training data and random feature selection in tree induction. Prediction is made by aggregating (majority vote or averaging)
the predictions of the ensemble.

Neurons in Deep Learning:
Neurons in deep learning models are nodes through which data and computations flow
These input signals can come from either the raw data set or from neurons positioned at a previous layer of the neural net.
They perform some calculations.

A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN)
MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear
activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron.

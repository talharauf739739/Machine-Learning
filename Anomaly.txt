Anomaly detection (aka outlier analysis) is a step in data mining that identifies data points, events, and/or observations
that deviate from a dataset's normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as a technical glitch,
or potential opportunities, for instance a change in consumer behavior.


Anomaly detection is the identification of rare events, items, or observations which are suspicious because they differ
significantly from standard behaviors or patterns. Anomalies in data are also called standard deviations, outliers, noise,
novelties, and exceptions.


From a very high level and in a very generic way, time series anomaly detection can be done by three main ways:
By Predictive Confidence Level Approach. 
Statistical Profiling Approach.
Clustering Based Unsupervised Approach.
